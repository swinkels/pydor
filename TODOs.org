- [ ] format Lisp code according to Batsov style guide
- [ ] for tests, leave visited file on teardown
- [ ] support raw docstrings, viz. ~r"""..."""~
- [ ] allow configuration of doctest options such as ~doctest.NORMALIZE_WHITESPACE~
- [ ] support namespace packages
- [ ] setup proper Python development environment
- [ ] describe development of Python part of ~pydor~
- [ ] support ~verbose~ to set logging to DEBUG option

* Done

- [X] use logging instead of ~print~

I also updated the log message so the message actually tells a story to the
user.

- [X] only bind ~execute-doctest~ for Python mode

This has been described in the README.

- [X] add README
- [X] make it work for Python modules in another package (when package is in search path)
- [X] allow configuration of additional sys paths
- [X] properly parse command-line parameters
- [X] make it work for Python modules in another subdirectory
- [X] let Lisp code use full path to ~use_finder.py~
- [X] setup proper Emacs Lisp development environment using Cask

I used Eask instead of Cask. Although up till now I used Cask, the lack of
up-to-date documentation was grating. Eask, which labels itself as a successor
to Cask, has a very similar interface, was easy to install and use.

- [X] retrieve module name in script
